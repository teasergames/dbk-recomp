## Bananza base 1.0.0

The folder installer accepts an already dumped base 1.0.0 ExeFS (`main`, `sdk`, `rtld`, `main.npdm`) and either a
loose RomFS folder or a folder containing `romfs.bin` and `index.json`. No keys or update are requested. An update
ExeFS fails the pinned SHA-256 checks in `tools/data/expected-dkb100.json` before the installer creates output or logs.

Run from this checkout with Python 3.12 or later, with the generator's dependencies (`tools/requirements.txt`). The
window also needs tkinter. The source checkout must contain the full runtime; the older TotK prebuilt runtime
library cannot build Bananza. A Windows tool package supplies:

```
<tools>/llvm/bin/clang.exe, llvm-ar.exe, llvm-windres.exe
<tools>/runtime/deps/include/, lib/       Vulkan, VMA, SDL3, Opus, libvpx and zstd dependencies
<tools>/bin/ninja.exe, SDL3.dll, libopus-0.dll
```

The package contains tools only, and may be kept separately from this checkout. No machine-specific path is built
into the installer. `--toolchain`, `--deps`, `--ninja` and `--dll-dir` override individual paths. Without `--package`,
the installer checks this checkout's existing toolchain layout. It never installs tools globally.

```
python -m installer --game bananza --exefs "<dump>/base/exefs" --romfs "<dump>/base/romfs" --dest "<install folder>" --package "<tools>" --jobs 6
```

The shader translator is reused when its `.id` matches the current translator sources. Pass `--translator
<path>/totk_xlate.exe` to choose a prebuilt translator, keeping `totk_xlate.id` beside it. Otherwise the installer
builds it with `tools/build_xlate.py` in its owned temporary folder. That path needs the .NET 10 SDK and, on Windows,
the Visual Studio C++ build tools and Windows SDK for NativeAOT. `--dotnet <portable-sdk>/dotnet.exe` selects a local
SDK; the checkout's `toolchain/dotnet` and PATH are also checked. These settings affect child processes only.

The native window uses the same CLI, steps and cancellation mechanism:

```
python -m installer.gui --package "<tools>"
```

Its pickers select ExeFS, RomFS, the optional tool package, language and destination. The individual tool overrides,
including `--translator` and `--dotnet`, also work on this command. `--game totk` selects the inherited TotK window.

The Bananza steps are:

1. Hash the supported ExeFS and all loose RomFS input files, reject overlapping or linked input/output paths,
   validate the tool paths and translator identity, then check disk space, AVX2 and Vulkan 1.3.
2. Stage ExeFS and run `tools/dkb_pack_romfs.py` for loose input. Read the packed image back, check its image checksum
   and every file against the initial content snapshot, then copy verified files into the destination. A prepacked
   input's checksum and bounds are checked too. This verifies packing integrity; a loose dump has no NCA hash tree
   to authenticate its original contents.
3. Prepare the matching shader translator.
4. Generate `main,sdk` into the temporary folder with the required `recomp/patches-dkb100.txt`. Missing applied patches
   stop the build. `subsdk0` is not generated.
5. Build `dkb100` from the current runtime sources with `tools/build_game.py`, without `--runtime-lib`, then copy the
   executable, runtime libraries and RomFS index into place. The default worker limit is six; `--jobs` changes it.
6. Translate the game's shaders: `tools/dkb_shader_census.py` lists the shader stages in the packed RomFS into
   `seed-nvn2.bin`, `dkb.exe --translate-shaders` lowers and translates them into the shader cache beside the executable
   (a few minutes, about 3 GB), and the pack is deleted. Without this step the first visit to each area waits for its
   shaders. Then `dkb.exe --warm-shaders` builds the driver's pipeline libraries; if that fails or the driver crashes
   (seen in `nvgpucomp64.dll` on NVIDIA 621.01) the installer warns and goes on, records `libraries: false` and does not
   retry, since the libraries only speed up the first draws. A translation failure fails the step.
7. Write the selected language while preserving existing settings, run the installed executable's `--selftest`, and
   remove only owned staging/build directories. Logs remain in the temporary folder. Setup does not start the game.

The portable output contains `dkb.exe`, its runtime DLLs, `totk_xlate.exe` and `.id`, `exefs/`, packed `romfs/`,
`romfs-index.bin`, `totk.ini`, `dkb-install.json` and the `shader-cache/` folder of step 6. The inherited `totk.ini` name is
intentional: the runtime reads it. Saves and further shader caches are created beside the executable when it runs. Source dumps stay untouched.

Only an empty destination or a Bananza install with matching ownership metadata is accepted. Temporary work has its
own ownership marker; an unrelated nonempty temporary directory is refused. OS-held locks prevent simultaneous
setups from writing the same destination or workspace and are released after process exit, including a crash.
Cancellation stops the installer's child process tree, leaves completed steps recorded atomically, and never deletes
source files, saves or other user settings. Partial files are not recorded as completed steps.

Resume with the same command, or `python -m installer --game bananza --dest "<install folder>"`. Recorded source and
tool paths are reused, input contents are fingerprinted again, and intact completed steps are skipped. Keep the source
folders available until setup completes. `--verify` also hashes kept output. Changed input, generator, required patch
table, runtime, dependencies or translator identity invalidates the corresponding steps. `--temp` selects a workspace
base; it is kept separate from the destination and sources. Re-running setup preserves `profile/`.

CLI exit codes and JSON events are the same as below. Lightweight checks, with no game files:

```
python tests/installer_bananza_test.py
python -m installer.gui --game bananza --selftest
```

A full generation/build and a title-screen run from the finished folder are separate end-to-end checks. Synthetic
installer tests do not establish game compatibility. No completed install, game-derived output or cache belongs in a
release or pull request. Release assembly in `tools/make_release*.py` still describes the inherited TotK package; a
Bananza release must include the complete runtime source/dependencies rather than its old runtime archive.

## Inherited TotK installer

The remainder documents the preserved TotK container workflow (`--game totk`).

A public release that turns the player's own game files into a playable TotK folder. The release carries no game
data and no code derived from the game: the installer builds the game on the player's machine. The installed folder
holds only the game; the installer and its tools stay outside it.

## What the player does

1. Downloads `TotK-Setup-<version>-windows.zip` from GitHub Releases (none is published yet), unpacks it anywhere and
   starts `TotK-Setup.exe`.
2. Picks:
   - the base game (XCI or NSP) and the 1.2.1 or 1.4.3 update (NSP);
   - their `prod.keys`;
   - the game language and the install folder.
3. Waits for the setup, one time. The window shows each step and its progress.
4. Plays `totk.exe` from the install folder. The installer and the source NSP or XCI can be deleted.

The install folder (`main.c` `portable_paths()` reads this layout; it stays portable):

```
<install folder>/
  totk.exe, SDL3.dll, libopus-0.dll, totk_xlate.exe
  totk.ini                       language; the other keys as commented defaults (totk.ini.example)
  exefs/, romfs/                 extracted from the player's files
  profile/                       saves
  logs/                          totk.log of the last run, totk.1.log to totk.4.log of the runs before it
  shader and pipeline caches     prepared by the setup; shader-cache/shader-cache.pack holds the translations
  totk-install.json              what built this folder: release version, input hashes, finished steps
```

## Updating the port

The player runs a newer installer on the same folder. It reads `totk-install.json`, keeps `romfs/`, `exefs/`,
`profile/` and `totk.ini` after checking their hashes, rebuilds `totk.exe` and re-prepares the shaders. A newer
release that changes nothing game-derived skips the rebuild.

Given an update file other than the recorded one (1.2.1, then 1.4.3), the installer extracts and builds again from it and
keeps `profile/`. Saves carry over both ways: 1.4.3 converts a 1.2.1 save on load, and 1.2.1 loads the saves 1.4.3 wrote.

## Setup steps

1. **Check** before writing anything: the files open with the keys, the update is 1.2.1 or 1.4.3 (by hash, as
   `tools/extract.py`), the keys are new enough for the update, enough space is free on the target disk (about 36 GiB at the peak of a
   first install, 20 GiB after it), the CPU has
   AVX2 (`-march=x86-64-v3`), a Vulkan 1.3 GPU exists. Each failure is one clear message.
2. **Extract** ExeFS and RomFS into the install folder and verify the hashes.
3. **Lift** the ExeFS to C (`recomp/gen.py`, `recomp/patches-v121.txt` or `patches-v143.txt`) into a temp folder next
   to the installer.
4. **Compile** the generated C, `modules.c`, `romfs.c`, `patches.c` and `ov_zstd.c` (they bake the per-install layout, RomFS
   hashes and the game version's patch page) and link
   them with the prebuilt runtime library into `totk.exe` (`build_game.py --runtime-lib`; about 3 min on 24 cores).
5. **Prepare** the RomFS patches and the shaders (`tools/make_romfs_patches.py`, `tools/prepare_shaders.py`,
   `totk.exe --prepare-shaders`) in the install folder, then fold the shader cache's loose files (four per shader, about
   117,000) into `shader-cache/shader-cache.pack` (`tools/pack_shader_cache.py`). totk.exe reads the pack first and
   writes the translations it makes in play as loose files; running the tool again with the game closed folds those in.
   The patches are written twice: `romfs-patches` and `romfs-patches-xbox` (`--xbox-prompts`, the A/B and X/Y prompts
   swapped for `pad_layout = xbox_prompts`).
6. **Clean up** the temp folder (generated C and objects, about 1.3 GB).

A cancelled or failed setup resumes from the last finished step (`totk-install.json`).

## Command line

`installer/` (stdlib only; `installer/layout.py` maps the release folder and, in a repository, the dev toolchain):

```
python -m installer --base FILE --update FILE --keys FILE --lang CODE --dest DIR [--root DIR] [--temp DIR] [--verify]
```

- On a folder with `totk-install.json` only `--dest` is needed; the game files only when the extraction must run again.
- stdout: one JSON event per line, types `start`, `plan`, `step` (started, done, skipped), `progress` (step, phase,
  done/total/unit), `space` (bytes needed and free on the install disk and the temp disk), `warning`, `error`, `end` (`installer/events.py`). Messages are ids with parameters;
  `installer/text/en.json` holds their English text. The human-readable log goes to `<temp>/logs/`.
- Exit codes: 0 done, 1 failed, 2 bad command line, 3 cancelled. The window cancels with Ctrl+Break to the
  installer's process group.
- Each step records a key over its inputs (runner.py). A step with the recorded key and intact output is skipped, so
  resume and update are one rule; output kept from another release is re-hashed first.
- Peak space on the install disk is about 36 GiB, not 22: the extraction copies both Program NCAs (16.3 GiB) next to
  the merged RomFS (15.9 GiB) before it deletes them. The check computes the exact figure.
- Window (`python -m installer.gui`, `installer/gui.py` draws, `installer/guilogic.py` decides): form, step list with
  progress, space line, collapsible log, Cancel (Ctrl+Break to the CLI's process group, then it waits for the exit),
  finish screen with Open folder. English or Russian, chosen from the Windows display language, switchable in the
  window; every sentence is an id in `installer/text/<en|ru>.json`. A folder with `totk-install.json` needs only the
  folder. `--selftest [--shots DIR]` builds every screen in both languages and closes itself.
- `tests/installer_gui_test.py`: event model, form, catalogs, cancel, the self-closing window and one end-to-end run
  of the CLI in `--verify` mode (needs `build/install-test` and `build/extracted/v121`; see its docstring).
- `tests/installer_test.py`: bookkeeping with fake steps. `tests/installer_e2e.py`: a dev-mode run with the files of
  `config.local.toml`.

## Release layout

The unpacked release; `tools/make_release.py` assembles it and `--zip` packs it:

```
TotK-Setup.exe        starts python/pythonw.exe -m installer.gui (installer/launcher/launcher.c, no console)
installer/            the installer: steps, CLI, window, en/ru text catalog
python/               Python 3.14.9 embeddable + numpy, lz4, cryptography, cffi, pycparser (+ tkinter for the window)
recomp/, tools/       the lifter and the build, extraction and shader scripts the steps run (copied from the repo)
llvm/                 llvm-mingw, x86_64-only subset (Apache-2.0 with LLVM exception; mingw-w64 parts permissive)
runtime/              libtotkrt.a and the headers the generated code and modules.c/romfs.c/patches.c include
bin/                  totk_xlate.exe, hactool.exe, SDL3.dll, libopus-0.dll, ninja.exe
data/                 shader_list.tsv (MacNativeGames, MIT)
THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md
totk.ini.example, VERSION  the default ini; the release string (the repository's VERSION plus the commit)
```

`make_release.py --game dkb` makes the Bananza folder (`DKB-Setup-<version>-windows.zip` with `--zip`) from the
same layout, with these differences: the launcher is `DKB-Setup.exe` (its two messages are the `dkb.launcher.*` ids);
`runtime/` holds every runtime source instead of `libtotkrt.a`, because the installer compiles the whole runtime at
install time; `bin/` has no `hactool.exe` (Bananza reads plain ExeFS and RomFS folders); `tools/` adds
`build_xlate.py`, `dkb_pack_romfs.py`, `dkb_shader_census.py`, `vendor/ryujinx` and `xlate` (the translator is built
at install); the lifted tree is `dkb100` instead of `v121`/`v143`.

- SDL3 comes from the upstream release, not MSYS2: MSYS2's DLL imports the LGPL libiconv.
- Every bundled third-party piece gets a row in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
- The release contains nothing game-derived; `make_release.py` runs `tools/check_content.py` over the folder before it
  finishes.

## Linux release

TotK only. There is no Linux release of Bananza yet; its release is the Windows `DKB-Setup-<version>-windows.zip`.

`tools/make_release_linux.py` builds the same setup for Linux and packs it as `TotK-Setup-x86_64.AppImage` (the static
type-2 runtime: no libfuse2 needed on the host). The player makes it executable and starts it; on a Steam Deck, from
Desktop Mode. Building the release also needs `make` and `pkg-config`. The bundled Tcl/Tk 9.0.4 is rebuilt with
Xft against the sniper sysroot so Russian text uses system TrueType fonts. The setup builds the game into the folder they pick, as on Windows, and the game is `totk` there with
`libSDL3.so.0` beside it. The folder inside the AppImage:

```
AppRun                starts python/bin/python3 -m installer.gui (no bytecode written into the read-only mount)
totk-setup.desktop, totk-setup.png
installer/, recomp/, tools/, data/, licenses/, THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md, totk.ini.example, VERSION   as on Windows
python/               python-build-standalone 3.14 (with tkinter) + the installer's packages; a .pth puts the folder,
                      tools/ and recomp/ on sys.path
llvm/                 LLVM 23 (clang, lld, llvm-ar) and llvm/sysroot: the files of the Steam Runtime 3 "sniper" SDK the
                      game's compile and link read (about 130 files)
runtime/              libtotkrt.a, headers, the install-side sources, totk.png; deps/ with the Vulkan headers, VMA and a
                      static zstd
bin/                  totk_xlate, hactool, ninja, libSDL3.so.0
```

- What we compile is built against the sniper sysroot (glibc 2.31): the game, hostcheck, hactool and the translator
  need no newer glibc. The game links Opus, libvpx, zstd and libstdc++ statically and needs only glibc, the system's
  Vulkan loader and the SDL3 beside it. The setup itself needs glibc 2.34 (Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Fedora 35,
  SteamOS 3): the official LLVM binaries and the `cryptography` wheel are built against it. `make_release_linux.py`
  checks every ELF file in the folder against that floor (`check_glibc`), and the setup's check step stops with one
  message on an older system.
- The setup's temp folder is `.setup-temp` inside the install folder (`--temp` changes it): the AppImage is mounted
  read-only, and a Steam Deck's `/home` is often too full for the generated C while the game goes to the SD card.
- The game keeps Mesa's shader cache in `mesa-cache` beside `totk` unless `MESA_SHADER_CACHE_DIR` is set, for the
  same reason: RADV fills its default folder in `~/.cache` up to 1 GB.
- The window follows `LANG` for English or Russian, cancels through SIGTERM to the CLI's process group (the CLI handles
  it as Ctrl+Break on Windows) and opens the finished folder with `xdg-open`.
- Requirements beyond Windows': Linux 6.7 or later (the write watch, `docs/building.md`) and glibc 2.34.
- Building the release needs one game version extracted and lifted (`tools/extract.py`, `recomp/gen.py`, either
  version): the runtime library includes the generated `layout.h`, whose shared part (`MOD_COUNT`, `MOD_MAIN_BASE`)
  is the same for both. `tools/make_release.py` takes `generated/v121`, else `generated/v143`.

## Constraints

- The installer steps contain no Win32 calls: Linux runs the same steps with its own compiler ("Linux release").
- The keys file path is passed to the tools; key values never appear in the UI, logs or files.
- The window is a front end over the CLI (`python -m installer --base ... --update ... --keys ... --lang ... --dest
  ...`), which prints one JSON progress event per line. Tests and CI use the CLI.
- Paths may hold any Unicode characters (a Cyrillic user name puts the temp and install folders under it). Every exe
  the setup runs or builds reads its arguments and paths as UTF-8 through an `activeCodePage` manifest: hactool
  (our patch, [building.md](building.md)), totk.exe (`runtime/totk.rc`), ninja (upstream). The Python steps write
  their files and logs as UTF-8, and `build_game.py` quotes paths with spaces on its Ninja command lines.
- A game file whose data fails its hash checks or ends early stops the setup with `check.input_damaged`, which names
  the file and asks to copy it again (`extract.DamagedFile`). A failed merge checks the base Program NCA alone to tell
  which file is damaged.
- Unsigned exe: SmartScreen warns on first start.

## Later

- Re-warm the driver cache on start after a move, GPU or driver change.
- NSZ and XCZ input.
